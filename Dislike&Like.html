          <p class="p3">
            I know what you don’t like, and I need to respect that.
            I should give you updates so you won’t have to overthink and so you can feel at peace.
            I should be careful with your feelings, because I know jealousy is real and it shows how much you love me.
            I should also stay away from people who have bad intentions. If someone tries to flirt, act clingy, or send
            flirty chats.
            I will block them right away. I will also unfollow girls that you feel jealous of, especially those who post
            sexy pictures or thirst traps, because I don’t want to hurt you.
          </p>
          <hr class="hr">
          <p class="p4">
            What matters most to me is your happiness. I should keep my attention only on you.
            I should be clingy only with you, flirt only with you, love only you, and like only you.
            You deserve that kind of loyalty, and I promise I will give it to you, because you are the only one I need.
