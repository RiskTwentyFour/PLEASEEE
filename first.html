    <div class="story">
      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph"> 1. It all started around July. That time I did not feel anything yet.
          I only knew she was 16, and I was surprised because she looked mature, not like a kid.
          I was not the one who said hi first. I only replied to her notes about the gym.
          She was asking something, and I answered because I wanted to. That is how we started
          talking, but it stopped after a while.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">2. When August came, the conversation started again. First on IG, then on Messenger.
          Same thing, replying to notes until it turned into us talking almost every day. We had the same vibe,
          and you would not think she was only 16. The way she talked, she seemed older.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">3. One day she gave me an update. She said she was going out to do a project.
          I wondered why she was telling me that, but I just said okay. That is when I noticed I was starting to like
          her. At first it was only a crush, but as time went on, I felt she liked me too.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">4. So I asked her out. I did not know how to ask a girl out. It was my first time.
          I even asked my friend for advice. But we still went out. We met at Parque, a coffee shop.
          We were not into coffee so I ordered carbonara and lemonade instead. I still remember telling her,
          “you are the first girl I spent money on.” She laughed and felt shy, but to me it was special.
          Even when I had a past relationship, it was long distance during the pandemic so I never did something like
          that.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">5. On the way home, we had the same route. I even paid for her fare.
          When she got home, she told her family right away. They asked if she had eaten, and she said yes,
          someone invited her. Then they asked if it was her boyfriend. She just laughed but even showed our picture.
          Good thing I looked decent there. Her mom and sister even said I looked 18.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">6. After that, we grew closer. I would even walk her to school all the time,
          as a way of spending quality time together. We shared hugs and kisses too, and honestly
          those moments were the best things I ever received from her. I really loved her so much.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">7. Our feelings grew stronger and we became together.
          But it did not last. She was part of a fraternity that was like her family.
          They did not allow her to have a boyfriend. She said it was possible but only in secret.
          One day we almost got caught, and that was when I realized I had no chance against the situation.
          If they knew I was with her, she could be removed from the group and I could get into trouble too.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-content">
        <div class="paragraph">8. So we decided to separate. Not because we did not want each other,
          but because of timing. Right person, wrong time.
          We still talk sometimes, but not like before. I let her focus on her studies.
          She is a top student, and she has a future to chase. And me,
          I learned that no matter how good the start is,
          sometimes the situation just cannot follow what the heart wants. I love you Gwen!</div>
