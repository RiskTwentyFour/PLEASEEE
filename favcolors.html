          <summary>1. Purple</summary>
          <p class="p1">
            If purple is your favorite color, you are caring, creative, and full of imagination.
            People are drawn to you even when you are quiet, and you inspire others with your unique spirit.
            You may struggle with daily challenges or feel moody when stressed, but balance helps you shine as your
            true, kind, and creative self.

        <details class="box-content yellow-box">
          <summary>2. Yellow</summary>
          <p class="p2">
            If yellow is your favorite color, you are cheerful, creative, and full of ideas.
            You prefer a small circle of close friends, think deeply, and love learning.
            Quick and spontaneous, you inspire others with your bright energy. At your best, you shine with intelligence
            and positivity.

          <h2>In Summary</h2>
          <p class="p3">
            If <span class="highlight-purple">purple</span> is your favorite, then it makes perfect sense because you
            are the kind of person who cares so deeply for others.
            People feel safe with you, they trust you, and they always find comfort in your presence. You are creative,
            mysterious, and you inspire me in ways you may not even notice.
            Even when you are quiet, I am drawn closer to you, because your soul speaks louder than words.
          </p>
          <hr class="hr">
          <p class="p4">
            If <span class="highlight-yellow">yellow</span> is your favorite, it is because you carry sunshine inside
            you. You brighten every space you walk into, you bring fun and warmth into my life,
            and even the simplest moments with you feel like something special. I love how your mind never runs out of
            ideas, how you keep your circle close, and how lucky I am to be one of the people you chose.
          </p>
          <hr class="hr">
          <p class="p5">
            To me, you are both <span class="highlight-purple">purple</span> and <span
              class="highlight-yellow">yellow</span>. You are calm and sunshine, mystery and joy, creativity and light.
            You are the balance that makes my world complete, the love that inspires me, and the reason my heart feels
            full every day. I love you for all that you are, and all that you bring into my life, Gwen.
